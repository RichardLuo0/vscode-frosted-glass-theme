## Direct Install
* From microsoft vscode marketplace, search for "Frosted Glass Theme", install
* Open command panel, type in "Frosted Glass Theme: Enable", press enter
* **You can change menu background color in vscode settings, every time you change something in settings, please execute "Frosted Glass Theme: Apply Configuration" to apply change**

### For Linux and perhaps MacOS user
You need to set `window.titleBarStyle` to `custom` to see the effect. Otherwise the effect is very limited.
## Uninstall
* Open command panel, type in "Frosted Glass Theme: Disable", press enter
* Uninstall from the extension panel as usual
## Known issues
* If the animation is flickering, try turn it off by setting `frosted-glass-theme.animation` to `none`
